# SQLChat â€“ Conversational Database Query System  

SQLChat is a full-stack application that enables users to interact with a SQL database using natural language queries. By integrating cutting-edge technologies, the application seamlessly translates user inputs into SQL statements, executes them, and returns human-readable responses.

## Features  
- **Natural Language to SQL**: Converts user queries into SQL commands using OpenAI's language model.  
- **Interactive UI**: Built with React for a responsive and dynamic user experience.  
- **Database Integration**: Leverages SQLite for efficient data storage and TypeORM for schema management.  
- **LLM-Powered Responses**: Provides intuitive, conversational responses to database queries using LangChain.  
- **Monitoring and Debugging**: Implements LangSmith for detailed monitoring of LLM interactions.

## Tools and Technologies  

### **Frontend**  
- **React**: For creating a modern, interactive user interface.  
- **CSS**: To style components and ensure responsive design.

### **Backend**  
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime for handling API requests and application logic.  
- **Express**: Lightweight framework to manage routing and middleware.  
- **SQLite**: Database for storing and managing structured data.  
- **TypeORM**: ORM for handling database schema and queries.  

### **AI and Generative Technology**  
- **LangChain**: Framework for integrating large language models with SQL databases.  
- **OpenAI**: Used for generating SQL queries and natural language explanations.  
- **LangSmith**: Debugging and monitoring platform for LLM-based applications.

### **Other Tools**  
- **dotenv**: For secure environment variable management.  
- **Git**: For version control.

## How It Works  
1. **Input**: Users type a natural language query into the web application.  
2. **Processing**: The backend sends the query to OpenAI via LangChain for SQL translation.  
3. **Execution**: The generated SQL query is executed against an SQLite database.  
4. **Response**: The results are processed and converted into a conversational response, which is displayed in the UI.
